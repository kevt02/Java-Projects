This project from 2021's Object-Orientated course at UW showcases my use of inheritance.
The purpose of this assignment was to create a mock bank account system that demonstrates features such as depositing, withdrawing.
This project also demonstrates features of account activity such as having a minimum amount of money to remain open. 
AccountTester.java is a driver to show example instantiation of Bank Account objects.
